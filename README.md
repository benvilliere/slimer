## Directory and File Content Visualisation CLI Tool

Slimer is a command line tool that helps you digest a folder structure and its file contents. It was designed to help with prompt engineering.

- Show the content of files in the structure with an optional character limit.
- Exclude or forcefully include specific files or directories.
- Recognize and tag binary files, with an option to include/exclude them.
- Limit the depth of directory exploration.
- Copy the result to the clipboard or output to a file.
- Filter the displayed files based on their modification time.
- Include specific files based on their extension.

## Installation

- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install slimer
```

## Dependencies
